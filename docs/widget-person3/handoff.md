# Handoff

Goal: eight widget UX stages; modify frontend/ and JS/browser tests only. Docs only here; no Python/backend/content changes or push/PR/deploy.
Repository: C:/Users/smous/OneDrive/Desktop/LAUNCHO/launchy/launcho-agent/launcho-agent.
Branch: work/widget-person3-quality. Baseline 6ff86df9ab5c4f4f23556147f4f330cf7cfd07a3; stage 1 a72b5ea; read git log for current HEAD.
Stages 1 through 7 locally checked; durable refresh recovery remains blocked. Production options/adapter and missing catalog previews remain external dependencies (dependencies.md).
Latest tests: session VM PASS; signup Chrome six form scenarios+all 23 previews/all recommendations PASS; HTTP 23/23; public Chrome render smoke23/23 PASS.
Reviewers approved source/excerpts only; no independent execution.
Stage7 Chrome and Edge full signup suites exit0 with mobile sheet/AX/reduced motion; target matrix and limitations in browser-coverage.md. Stage6 commit29b1ad2. Next: stage8 final controlled regressions, screenshot/report evidence, installation and PR-ready description; no push/PR/deploy.
Commands: node tests/widget_signup_browser.cjs; node tests/widget_sessions_browser.cjs; node --experimental-vm-modules tests/widget_session_test.cjs.
Main has filesystem/terminal/Git; reviewers receive concrete code/results and disclose own checks. No reliable cumulative token counter or root-session migration tool.
